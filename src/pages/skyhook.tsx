        <AnimatedDiv className="header2 text-amber-500">Get to know the new neighbors</AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">There has been a persistent buzz in my climbing community (<i>Matt</i>) about this new kid on the block. Today I opened my social media to discover an ad about Skyhook touting direct Bouldering Project influence, and offering hard hat tours. Well dadgummit, I just wrote an article panning Portland gyms for their lack of Bouldering Project influence. I picked up the phone, dialed and got voicemail. Oh well.</AnimatedDiv> 
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">But then I actually got a callback. This is Cody, a cheerful voice says, sorry I missed your call. He sounds enthusiastic, that he loves calls like these, calls simply about sharing the news. So I put some pants on and make the 6 minute journey. After a minute of poking around the perimeter I find a door cracked open and let myself in and moments later am shaking hands with Cody, Owner, Founder, Head of Construction at Skyhook.</AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">Within seconds, Cody elaborates on the influence of Bouldering Projects. He has been advised that Euro Holds, like the ones at SBP, ABP, etc., are the way to go despite being up to twice as expensive and requiring significant lead time to acquire. I am inclined to agree personally; they are simply more fun to climb on and I don't really know why nor care. </AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">We turn our attention to the space in front of us. I’d estimate it’s about the same floor footage as SW Circuit, and only about a third of the walls have already taken form. But goodness, what a third it is. The features are big and bold, like the grand floor to ceiling arete, or the 70 degree overhang that yawns out and over into a large arch, a feature very reminiscent of ABP's arch (and which also brings to mind and makes the arch at SW Circuit feel almost childish). These features will support extended move sequences requiring unique skillsets. Big win. They already have a BP-style lacquer on them, with rough texture which supports thin smearing. Another huge win. The roof above us, made of exposed beams, is about a body length above the highest point of the walls- too low to allow topouts, which I was never a fan of anyways. Cody explains to me the evolution of modern guidelines on padding and spacing, suggesting more and more space between walls, ideas he has conscientiously adopted. </AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">Cody also emphasizes his attraction to slab and points out a wide slab wall in the back. I've always loved outdoor slab and the slabs at SBP/ABP, but I never liked Circuit or Movement slab. Possibly because of the lack of friction on the holds and/or walls, because PRG Beaverton does have enjoyable slab with its wonderful new holds. </AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">Cody points out a back wall which will be a large live plant wall. Lounge spaces will be scattered throughout, with wide walkways that intend to obviate the awkward squirm-dodging of other gyms. </AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">Through a garage door-sized opening is a smaller area which will house a few more walls, an approxmiately 25' x 25' (eyeballed) workout area and a living-room sized coworking space and more lounge areas. Cody states the coworking room doubles as a small birthday party space but is quick to emphasize larger parties will be directed to Tigard. This room, like the climbing chamber, has large South-facing windows that promise plenty of natural lighting in the future. A spray wall will be here, and hopefully a systems board is somewhere on the horizon. I imagine what I've always wanted out of Portland gyms- somewhere bright and cheerful to program and work my brain straight into overheating, and then another somewhere 10 feet away to ventilate out through my finger tendons. </AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">The last area appears to be the front entryway. A strangely beak-shaped foyer with a lower ceiling. We talk about 24/7 access, about the extra hurdles of insurance, and planned safety measures like Life Alert tags, double entry monitoring, double gates. </AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para pb-5">It is clear to me he and his team have put a lot of thought into the design of the gym. So this is where I invite him to share about his background. Raised in Clackamas, Cody started climbing decades ago when his brother was working as a Ranger in Yosemite. For a couple weeks, they lived there and wandered around hiking and climbing rocks. I relate how I had a similar experience, and how we have probably both been chasing that high ever since... </AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="header2 text-amber-500">Bottom line?</AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">I think my impression is that Cody and his team have a specific vision of a climbing gym that does two things: feel hip, bright, and welcoming, and also have state of the art climbing and setting. I have high hopes they can achieve both of these things. I wonder if the black walls won't feel as bright and playful as the Bouldering Project seafoam green, but this may be offset by the ample natural lighting, planned two tiered artificial lighting system, and cheerful decor (like the live wall). </AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">I am also vaguely concerned that the pure climbing wall footage (which is comparable to SW Circuit) isn't enough to gracefully handle popularity despite very conscious efforts to amply space features apart. I concede that even SBP frequently struggles with this, but their roofs are higher which might help some psychologically. Frankly, this will be a good problem for Skyhook to have, but not for me, who likes having the entire gym to himself ;)</AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">A worst case scenario is that the large North and South facing windows and lighting system are somehow still not quite good enough to brighten up the dark walls, and we get yet another dark, crowded gym, but with excellent Euro Holds and routesetting. But the more optimistic (and probable) scenario is that Skyhook becomes a small Portland Bouldering Project: bright, spacious, welcoming and cheerful, a place where friends can come and feel good climbing on great routesetting and then go next door to Double Dragon and enjoy a bite together.</AnimatedDiv>
        <AnimatedDiv className="para">So my bottom line is that this gym is a great deal at the price being offered right now, particularly for those that will make good use of the 24/7 access (like my friends with young children and/or in healthcare), those that like to mix coworking and climbing like me, and those that enjoy nice climbing holds and big, fun Bouldering Project-style features and setting. This climber is stoked to return. ✌️</AnimatedDiv>
