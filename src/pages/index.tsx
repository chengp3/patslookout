          <p className="mt-4 mb-4">My name is Patrick üëãüèª I solve problems with software. This website is part portfolio and part workshop/lab where I host personal projects.</p>
          <p className="mt-4 mb-4">A little about me. I was born in Austin, Texas, and then discovered a love for mountains; now I currently live in Portland, OR.</p>
          <p className="mt-4 mb-4">Software-wise, (chronologically) I have been a financial data engineer for the SEC using Hadoop-based pipelines. I've used scikitlearn machine learning algorithms to diagnose leukemia. Lately I have been doing full stack web development for <a href="https://www.galacticpolymath.com"><b>Galactic Polymath</b></a>. Mostly NextJS-based stuff.

          <p className="mt-4 mb-4">The picture above is from the summit of Mailbox Peak near Seattle, WA, and inspired the domain name for this site. That's Mount Rainier in the distance! I will incorporate a trip journal and gallery here soon.
